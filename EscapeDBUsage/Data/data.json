Selecting a row/s allows the user to align the selected row/s (with the Balance Selected button).  The Balance Table button aligns all records in the selected table, while the Balance All Tables button will align all master-data.  Use this function with caution, as it will overwrite all edits that you have made to the master-data! Masterdata Integrity Check The integrity check attempts to identify potential missing masterdata which could cause issues.
