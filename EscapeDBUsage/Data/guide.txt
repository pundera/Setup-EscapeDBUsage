#Route Matrix - This is the primary method for maintaining route details.  All depot Locations (including external warehouses) are listed across the top and down the side of the page. With “From” locations i.e. Sources being across the top and “To” i.e. destinations being down the side of the page. Each block has two cells; the type of route - ‘I’ for inter-brewery balancing and ‘t’ for inter-depot, the cost of a load on this route. When this data is saved it creates or deletes records or updates the costs of existing records in the Route table.  Be sure to go to the Route sheet after to add additional data.

Has Return route? - used to configure if a route is an “Outbound” route and that the route in the opposite direction is a “Return” route.   This means that a route with the “Has return route?” flag set to 1 will be planned as normal, but the volume on the “Return” route (i.e. the opposite direction) will have volume constrained.  ,It is critical not to define both routes (i.e. A to B and B to A) as having returns routes, as this will force AP to plan exactly the same volume in both directions, always  For routes between breweries, only one should be configured as having a return route (the dominant one), or (preferably) neither so that movements can be freely planned by AP.

#IN <> CORE - This function is used to align master-data in the ISP database with the latest version in the iHub. This alignment can be done, by record, by table or total.  Selecting the table in the list at the top of the page displays all records and fields where there are differences in the lower half of the screen.  Selecting a row/s allows the user to align the selected row/s (with the Balance Selected button).  The Balance Table button aligns all records in the selected table, while the Balance All Tables button will align all master-data.  Use this function with caution, as it will overwrite all edits that you have made to the master-data!
